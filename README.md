#Volume Control with Hand Detection# üéõÔ∏è
This project enables real-time control of system volume using hand gestures, leveraging computer vision and machine learning. It utilizes OpenCV, MediaPipe, and Pycaw to capture hand landmarks, detect finger distance, and adjust volume accordingly.

Features
Real-Time Volume Control: Adjust system volume by varying the distance between your thumb and index finger.
Interactive Visualization: Visual indicators show the hand landmarks, connecting lines, and dynamic volume levels.
User-Friendly: Volume level and percentage are displayed, giving immediate feedback on the current volume setting.
Technologies Used
Python: For core logic and integration
OpenCV: For webcam interaction and real-time video processing
MediaPipe: For hand landmark detection
Pycaw: To control system audio through Python
How It Works
Hand Detection: MediaPipe identifies and tracks hand landmarks, focusing on the thumb and index finger.
Distance Calculation: The distance between the thumb and index fingertips is calculated in real time.
Volume Mapping: The finger distance is mapped to the system's volume range using Pycaw, adjusting the volume proportionately.
Visual Feedback: Visual indicators are drawn on the webcam feed to show the distance between fingers and the current volume level.
